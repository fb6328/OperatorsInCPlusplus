/*end{code} The code snippet provided is incomplete and does not include the implementation of the linked list operations.However,
    it defines the structure of the linked list using an array in C++.The structure `Node` contains two fields : `data` to store the value of the node and `next` to store the index of the next node in the array.The `#define ` directive is used to define a constant `MAX_SIZE` which represents the maximum
        size of the array used to store the linked list nodes.*/
